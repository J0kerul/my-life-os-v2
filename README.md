# 🃏 Joker's Hub - MyLifeOS 2.0

I was always a big fan of LifeOS systems. As they severy help organizing my life. However i have found that most of the systems out there were either pretty costly or just didn't fit my needs to the degree that i wanted them to. So I decided why not make my own? It's a great learning experience to create, maintain und update modules on this project.

## 🎉 Features
- **Modular Design**: Each domain (Tasks, Dashboard, etc.) is independently structured, with relations between Modules where it makes sense
- **Dashboard-Centric Approach**: The System features a Dashboard which is used for quick actions and acces on important parts from different modules
- **Widget System**: Modular Widgets for different data views and action to separate and structure workflows properly
- **Custom Visual Elements**: The system has handcrafted SVG Icons aswell as Lucide icons for better visual enhancement
- **Sidebar Navigation System**: Space efficient Sidebar navigation with expandable categories in which modules are separated

## ✨ Modules

### Dashboard
- **Time-based greetings**: Dynamic messages based on current time
  - 6-12: "Good Morning, Alex"
  - 12-18: "Hey, Alex"
  - 18-0: "Good Evening, Alex"
  - 0-6: Random messages
- **Backlog Widget**: Top 10 backlog tasks with quick actions
- **Next 7 Days Widget**: Upcoming tasks including overdue items
- **Quick Add**: Create tasks directly from widgets
- **Task Detail Modal**: View and edit tasks from dashboard

### Task Manager
- **Dual-list system**: Deadline tasks & Backlog tasks
- **11 Domain categories**: Work, University, Personal, Coding, Health, Finance, Social, Home, Study, Travel, Administration
- **Priority system**: High, Medium, Low with visual indicators
- **Rich task details**: Title, Description, Deadline, Domain, Priority
- **German date formatting**: DD.MM.YYYY
- **Advanced filtering**: By domain, deadline range, completion status
- **Smart sorting**: By date or priority, completed tasks sorted to bottom
- **Deadline awareness**: Red for overdue/today, yellow for tomorrow
- **Custom scrollbars**: Joker-themed dark UI
